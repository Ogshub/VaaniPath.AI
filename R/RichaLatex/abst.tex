My Task Manager is a lightweight, web-based to-do list application designed to help users efficiently organize and manage their daily tasks. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, this application provides a simple yet effective solution for task management without requiring backend infrastructure or user authentication. The system features task creation with optional date/time scheduling, automatic task sorting, completion tracking, and browser-based local storage for data persistence.

The project addresses the need for a privacy-focused, offline-capable task management tool that prioritizes simplicity and ease of use over feature complexity. By leveraging modern web technologies and browser APIs, the application delivers a responsive user interface with real-time updates and efficient task management.

Key features include CRUD operations for tasks, intelligent sorting (incomplete tasks first, then by due date), persistent storage using localStorage, and a colorful, modern design that enhances user engagement. The application runs entirely in the browser, ensuring complete data privacy and eliminating dependency on external servers or internet connectivity.
